Test Framework
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The initially small testing manager has grabbed my interest and I'd like to
do a proper job on it. The features I'm looking for are
   - Ability to run tests automatically
   - Ability to group tests into suites and choose which suites to run
   - Detailed test failure info
   - Custom asserts for common data types
   - Persistance through fatal test errors
   - Store logs of test runs
